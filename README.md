## Description 

For this project I worked in JS using Node.js to create a deployment ready HTML file to display drop teams based off of command line inputs. This project utilized Jest testing and  OOP structuring, as well as inquire for prompting user feedback.

## Key Features
* responsive design
* fully command line driven 
* manager, engineer, and intern employee data prompted using inquire
* name, email, id, and job specific data prompted and collected
* appropriate data including emails and URLs linked on generated HTML page
* Jest proofs in case of future changes provided for key objects
* OOP structuring centered on employee data

## Installation
Download files from [this github repo](https://github.com/cgsdesign/TeamProfileGenerator). Then, in your command line, go into the main README-Gen folder and type node index.js. The file will automatically run.
